# English-Premier-League-Analysis

### The English Premier League is the top level of competition in English football. It is widely regarded as one of the most competitive and is one of the most watched sports competitions in the world.

I found a dataset which contains these data for each season of the premier league:

- Season
- Date
- Referee
- Home teams and away teams
- Results at full time and at half-time
- Number of goals scored by the home team at full time and that at half-time
- Number of goals scored by the away team at full time and that at half-time
- Number of: shots, shots on target, corner kicks, fouls committed, yellow cards received, and red cards received. Each of these pieces of information is available for both the home team and the away team.

I have downloaded the data for 10 seasons from 2011/2012 till 2020/2021 and I'm working on my project with this data.

### In this project I answer some questions like:

- Which team got more points through all the years ?
- Which team got more goals through all the years ?
- Which teams stayed at the premier league without getting relegated ?
- Which refree tend to give more red cards ?
- Does playing home affect the number of red cards you get ?
- What features affect most the probability of a team winning a match ?

### This project consists of 3 phases

### Phase 1: Data Wrangling
- Gathering the data
- Assessing the data
- Cleaning the data

### Phase 2: Data Analysis
- Analysis
- Visuals
- Conclusions

### Phase 3: Machine Learning
- Machine learning models
- Results and predictions
